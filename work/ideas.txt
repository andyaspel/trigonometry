 calculate x,y points on tangent of circle.
 calculate sides of all types of triangle.
 visualize these using canvas.
 already have template for co-ordinate system,
 have some functions already, can use these to 
 compose functions to perform what I want.
 future plans - build machine co-ordinate system
 G53 = Machine zero-point, then add
 G54 -> G59, later add G54P1 -> G54Pn.
